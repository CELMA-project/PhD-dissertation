\section{Kinetic energy}
For a single particle, we have
%
\begin{align*}
E_{\text{kin}} = \frac{1}{2}m\mathbf{v}^2,
\end{align*}
%
which means that for a fluid, we have
%
\begin{align*}
E_{\text{kin}}=\frac{1}{2}m\int n\mathbf{u}^2 \d V
\end{align*}
%
Due to gyroviscous cancellation, we have that to first order, only the $E\times B$-drift is carrying particles.
This gives
%
\begin{align*}
    E_{\text{kin},\alpha}
    =& \frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\int
       n\mathbf{u}_E^2
       + n\mathbf{u}_{\alpha,\parallel}^2 \d V
     \\
    =& \frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\int
       n\left(\frac{-\nabla_\perp\phi
              \times\mathbf{b}}{B}\right)^2
       + n\mathbf{u}_{\alpha,\parallel}^2 \d V
    \\
    =& \frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\int
       n\left(\left[\frac{-\nabla_\perp\phi}{B}\right]^2
       + [\mathbf{u}_{\alpha,\parallel}]^2\right) \d V
   \\
    =& \frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\iiint
       n\left(\left[\frac{-\nabla_\perp\phi}{B}\right]^2
       + [\mathbf{u}_{\alpha,\parallel}]^2\right)
       J \d\rho \d\theta \d z
    \\
    =& \frac{1}{2}m_i\frac{m_{\alpha}}{m_i}
       n_0c_s^2\rho_s^3
       \iiint
       \tilde{n}\tilde{u}_\alpha^2
       \tilde{J} \d \wt{\rho} \d\theta \d \wt{z}
    \\
    =& m_in_0c_s^2\rho_s^3 \tilde{E}_{\text{kin},\alpha}
    \\
    =& n_0T_{e,0}\rho_s^3 \tilde{E}_{\text{kin},\alpha}

\section{Potential energy}
%
A proper derivation can be done where one use the variational principle of the Lagrangian of the system to find the energy of the system.

One can also derive the potential energy in a less formal way by looking at the transfer terms of the equations, and find which energy terms which are not the kinetic energy.
If one neglects the small energy from the fields, one is left with.
When this is done, one find that
