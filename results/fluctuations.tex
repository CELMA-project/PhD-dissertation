\section{Characteristics of the fluctuations}
%
We will in this chapter characterize the fluctuations.
One can observe from \cref{fig:2DFluct} the fluctuations can be quite strong, something which has also been observed experimentally in for example \cite{Burin2005}.
To get a better feeling of how strong the fluctuations are, we can compare the steady state profiles with the turbulent profiles.
\Cref{fig:posOfFluct01} gives such a comparison.

    \caption{Flattening of the profiles together with the position of the fluctuations for $B=0.1\T$.
        The subscripted $_\text{Steady state}$ denotes steady state variables, whereas variables without subscript denotes quantities in the saturated turbulence phase.
        A poloidal and temporal average (containing the whole time series) have been done in order to get a good avergaged picture of the turbulent profile.
        The shaded area represents the standard deviation.

    \label{fig:posOfFluct01}
\end{figure}
%
As apparent from the figure, the amplitude of the fluctuations are the largest around the maximum gradient.
We also note that the background profiles are flattened by the turbulence.
This is an important feature which need to be considered when modelling the plasma.

Models like Hasegawa-Wakatani \cite{Hasegawa1987,Holland2007} are splitting the fluctuations from the background (a so-called Reynolds decomposition), and are evolving only the fluctuation in time.
In such models, the free energy in the background gradients are driving the fluctuations, and the feedback of the fluctuation on the background profiles are neglected.
This is good approximation if the fluctuations are small.
On the other hand, if the fluctuations are large as in \cref{fig:posOfFluct01}, the background gradients are altered, and so is the drive for the fluctuations.
A global approach as taken in models like CYTO \cite{Naulin2008,Windisch2011a,Windisch2011b} and CELMA is therefore needed.
With such a global approach, the change in the driving force for the turbulence is accounted for, and it enables one to investigate the backreaction to the background from the fluctuations.

Further investigation of the turbulence can be done using the time traces at a fixed point.
This is done in \cref{fig:combinedPlots008}.

Again, we can observe that the fluctuations are large in amplitude, and increasingly intermittent for higher radius.
The power spectra density (PSD) shows that several frequencies are present simultaneously, and that the system is more turbulent at the edge.
This behavior is captured by the probability density functions (PDF), which measures the chance to encounter a value within an infinitesimal range, if a value at a random time is withdrawn from the time trace.
Consequentially, if all values are equally probable, the PDF will have a Gaussian shape.
Deviations from the Gaussian shape is usually measured by the statistical moments skewness%
%
\footnote{
    The skewness is a measure of the mass of the distribution.
    If the skewness is negative, the left tail of the distribution is bigger than the right.
    For a pure Gaussian the skewness is 0.
}
%
and kurtosis
%
\footnote{
    The kurtosis is a measure of extreme events present in the distribution.
    For a pure Gaussian the skewness is 3.
    If the kurtosis is less than 3 (platykurtic) the distribution produces fewer and less extreme outliers than a Gaussian.
    If the kurtosis is greater than 3 (leptokurtic) there are more extreme outliners, and the tails approaches zero slower than a Gaussian.
}

.
Figure \cref{fig:skewKurt008} highlights how this varies with the radius.
One can see that close to the center, it is more probable to encounter a large negative fluctuation than a positive fluctuation.
Then, for higher radii, large positive fluctuations becomes more and more frequent.
From the excess kurtosis, we can see that extreme events are less likely than in a Gaussian random process, whereas extreme events are almost twice as likely in the edge as in a Gaussian random process.

Finally it can be noted that the radial turbulent transport is mainly positive and even more intermittent than the fluctuations in density alone.
