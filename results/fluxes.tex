\section{Fluxes}
\label{sec:fluxes}
%
We are here interested in quantifying the losses in the system due to the turbulent transport.
This can be done by integrate the \emph{density flux} (obtained by multiplying the density fluctuations with the fluctuation in the $E\times B$-drift, and with the units "particles $\m^{-2}\s^{-1}$") over a surface $\mathcal{S}$.

This gives us the \emph{particle flux} (alternatively the density flow), with the units "particles per seconds".
Na{\"i}vely, one could think that using the simulation domain as $\mathcal{S}$ would make sense.
However, as we have enforced $\phi=0$ at $\rho=L_\rho$, $u_{E,\rho}=0$ as $\partial_\theta \phi=0$ (see \cref{poi:cylExB}).
As a side note, we note that very little plasma can escape the simulation domain radially as $\phi=0$ and because the Neumann condition on the density at the outer radius gives a diffusion of $\partial_\rho^2 n \simeq 0$.
Hence, almost all the plasma escapes in the parallel direction.

As we would like to investigate the radial turbulent particle flux, we therefore set the radius of $\mathcal{S}$ to be shorter than the radius where the $\phi=0$ enforcement starts (that is at the domain boundary), but still outside the main part of the particle source.
The result is shown in \cref{fig:flux008}, and gives a comparison to the parallel particle flux out of the simulation domain.

In the linear phase after $0.02\s$, the radial flux is almost zero due to the small amplitudes of the fluctuations in the potential and density.
An overshoot in the energy, just like the one seen in \cref{fig:energyTrace008} follows the linear phase.
From that point in time the radial flux comes burst-wise throughout the simulation.

Although the particles are not escaping the domain in the perpendicular direction, the total perpendicular particle flux through $\mathcal{S}$
is approximately $10\%$ of the parallel flux out of the domain.
We can also observe that almost as many ions as electrons are lost in the parallel direction ($99\%$).
Physically, this means that the plasma is charging up very little over time, and would thus not break the assumption of quasi-neutrality.
