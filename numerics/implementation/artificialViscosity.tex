\section{Artificial viscosity}\label{sec:art_visc}
%
In the derivation we have neglected terms which is of order lower than first order, as these terms are believed to have negligible contribution on the overall set of equation.
One of the drawbacks is, however, that we also have neglected viscous terms which will dampen small scales in the system.
Thus, if we no not re-introduce some dissipation for numerical purposes, energy is going to build-up on small scales, and would in the end make the simulation crash.
%FIXME: Add cite to Phillips instability if applicable

Therefore, we add a dissipation on the form

\begin{align*}
    D_{f, \|, \text{art}} \nabla_{\|}^2 f
    + D_{f, \perp, \text{art}} \grad_\perp^2 f
    &=
    D_{f, \|, \text{art}} \div \L(\ve{b}\ve{b}\cdot\grad\R) f
    + D_{f, \perp, \text{art}} \grad_\perp^2 f
    \note{$\partial_i \ve{b} = 0$}
    \\
    %
    &=
    D_{f, \|, \text{art}} \ve{b}\cdot\grad \L(\ve{b}\cdot\grad\R) f
    + D_{f, \perp, \text{art}} \grad_\perp^2 f
    \\
    %
    &=
    D_{f, \|, \text{art}} \partial_\|^2 f
    + D_{f, \perp, \text{art}} \grad_\perp^2 f
    \numberthis
    \label{eq:art_vort}
\end{align*}
%
by exchanging $\div \te{\pi}$ in equarion (\ref{fluideq:mom}) with \cref{eq:art_vort}.
This is a somewhat crude approximation, but serves as a good first approximation.
In the non-normalized set of equations the $D$ coefficients would have the units of dynamical viscosity, and would be normalized by

We notice that when using equation (\ref{fluideq:mom}) in the derivations, division by $n$ on the RHS of the equations occurs in the density equation and the parallel momentum equations, but not in the vorticity equation.
The artificial viscosity in the density is not divided by $n$ as $\frac{1}{n}\grad n = \ln(n)$.
