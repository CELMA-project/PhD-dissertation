\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

During the work of this thesis I have had the wonderful opportunity to work with, discuss with and obtain help from many people which I would here like to pay my homage to.

I would like the express my gratitude towards my supervisors Prof. Jens Juul Rasmussen and Prof. Volker Naulin for giving me the opportunity to carry out this work in the PPFE group.
The many discussions with Prof. Rasmussen, who has always met me with patience and a joyful spirit, has been of great help.
Our discussions about linear wave theory and plasma turbulence has been particularly helpful.
Further, the invaluable help on the numerical treatment of singularity in the cylinder axis and with the inversion algorithm for the potential from Prof. Naulin is highly appreciated.
So is his grand overview over plasma physics and his remarkable skill to draw fast conclusions from complex physical models.

Next, I would like to thank my co-supervisor, researcher Jens Madsen, for his insight in numerical methods, his patience with my many questions, for helping me with his expertise with curvilinear coordinate systems.
I have also benefited greatly from senior scientist Anders Henry Nielsen for his expertise in usage of the super computers.

Besides my colleagues at PPFE, I have had the pleasure to work with PPFE's collaborators at the University of York.
My wholehearted appreciation goes to Dr. Benjamin D. Dudson for his indispensable help, for prioritizing his valuable time to discussions with me and for being so forthcoming.
My thanks also goes to Dr. Jarrod Leddy, Dr. Peter Hill, Dr. David Dickinson and Dr. Brendan Shanahan for our fruitful discussions.
The rest of the BOUT++ collaborators deserves a thanks for their technical assistance, efforts to make BOUT++ a well-tested, documented and easy-to-use software.

I would like to thank my close colleagues which I have been so lucky to share an office with, namely Dr. Ning Yan, Frederik Treue, Dr. Asger Schou Jacobsen, Alexander Simon Thrys{\"o}e, Jeppe Miki Busk Olsen, Aslak Sindbjerg Poulsen and Galina Avdeeva. Thank you for the good discussions and the great humor in the office.
I would especially like to thank Alexander Simon Thrys{\o}e for the lengthy discussion we have had about physics and mathematics, and for the friendship with him and his wife outside the office time.

Besides my colleagues, I have had the most fortunate chance to get to know Dr. Clemens Sch{\"a}fermeier.
I would like to thank him for our great bicycle trips, and our many good discussions about philosophy, physics and the Ph.D.-student life.

I would like to thank Alexander Simon Thrys{\o}e, Mirko Salewski and Dr.  Asger Schou Jacobsen for proof-reading this manuscript.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for always supporting me, and I would like to dedicate a very special thank you to my wife, Lenka Magnussen, who has supported me so much during the whole thesis, and for taken so good care of our son during the moments when daddy have had to work late.
I could really not have done this without your support!
