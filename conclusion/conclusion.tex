DRAFT



A drift-fluid model, CELMA, has been derived both with and without the use of the Boussinesq approximation.


The equations in these models have been solved using the BOUT++ framework.


Amongst the findings is the










Outlook for future work

Although CSDX like parameters chosen, not bound to any linear machine

Scans of how the findings scales with increased radial extent of domain, increased parallel domain
note that computational time may drastically increase

Background plasma amplitude changing, and shape of source

Better model for the neutrals, neutral transport in a linear machine can be investigated
similar to what has been done in leddy et al

different types of Boussinesq
can be modelled in an energy conserving way

Make the parallel domain periodic,
Introduce a poloidal annulus with sheath boundary conditions
A crude model of the scrape off layer without curvature
investigate non-curvature effects.

Model crude, extend with energy equations of both electrons and ions
Investigations of energy load

Changing the metric
Requires changes in the model, further testing is needed
Model used in FCI avoid problems regarding the metric
The effect of shear in the magnetic field
X-point etc
