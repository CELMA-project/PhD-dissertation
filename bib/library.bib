abstract = {In this paper we consider a conservative discretization of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We propose an extension of Arakawa's classical finite difference scheme for fluid flow in the vorticity–stream function formulation to a high order discontinuous Galerkin approximation. In addition, we show numerical simulations that demonstrate the accuracy of the scheme and verify the conservation properties, which are essential for long time integration. Furthermore, we discuss the massively parallel implementation on graphic processing units.},

abstract = {The mechanism for generation of mean poloidal flow by turbulence is identified and elucidated.  Two methods of calculating poloidal flow acceleration are given and shown to yield predictions which agree.  These methods link flow generation to the quasilinear radial current or the Reynolds stress {\textless}V approximately r V approximately-theta{\textgreater}.  It is shown that poloidal acceleration will occur if the turbulence supports radially propagating waves and if radial gradients in the turbulent Reynolds stress and wave energy density flux are present.  In practice, these conditions are met in the tokamak edge region when waves propagate through the outermost closed flux surface or when convection cells with large radial correlation length are situated in steep gradient regions.  The possible impact of these results on the theory of the L --{\textgreater} H transition is discussed.},

The simulations show a relation between self-generated poloidal shear flows and magnetic field perturbations. For large values of the plasma {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}we observe an increase of the transport if the viscous damping of the self-generated shear flows is absent. This behavior is in contrast to the standard argument that sheared flows suppress turbulence and transport via a decorrelation mechanism. An explanation of this behavior in terms of the transport related to magnetic flutter is proposed. The characteristics of the EB flux are investigated using probability density distribution functions (PDFs). Although they are not Gaussian, no signs of algebraic tails in the PDFs are observed. The PDFs of the pointwise transport are found to agree well with a folded Gaussian, while the PDFs of the spatially averaged transport are in good agreement with an extreme value distribution.},

The turbulent radial particle flux is found to peak near the density gradient maximum and vanishes at the shear layer location. The shape of the radial plasma potential profile associated with the azimuthal E x B flow is predicted accurately by theory.

abstract = {The conceptual development and implementation of a scalable nonlinear solver for the time-dependent three-dimensional (3D) compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics model (MHD) is discussed. The approach is based on Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov technology, preconditioned with multigrid methods for algorithmic scalability. The key to the approach is the reformulation of the hyperbolic MHD system into a parabolic one, which is amenable to multigrid techniques. Such reformulation (parabolization) aims to render the modified system block diagonally dominant (unlike the original MHD system, which is diagonally submissive for implicit time steps $\Delta$ t larger than the explicit Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy time step). The algorithm has been tested on a variety of 2D and 3D configurations which demonstrate its excellent algorithmic scalability properties. In particular, it is shown that, serially, the CPU time for a given simulation scales linearly with the number of unknowns, and that large CPU gains ( ∼ 30 ) are attainable with respect to an explicit approach even for moderate grids ( 256 × 256 ) . In parallel, the algorithm features excellent scalability properties up to thousands of processors (4096) and millions of unknowns ( ∼ 1.3 × 10 8 ) .},

abstract = {A blob-filament (or simply “blob”) is a magnetic-field-aligned plasma structure which is considerably denser than the surrounding background plasma and highly localized in the directions perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field B. In experiments and simulations, these intermittent filaments are often formed near the boundary between open and closed field lines, and seem to arise in theory from the saturation process for the dominant edge instabilities and turbulence. Blobs become charge-polarized under the action of an external force which causes unequal drifts on ions and electrons; the resulting polarization-induced E × B drift moves the blobs radially outwards across the scrape-off-layer (SOL). Since confined plasmas generally are subject to radial or outwards expansion forces (e.g., curvature and ∇B forces in toroidal plasmas), blob transport is a general phenomenon occurring in nearly all plasmas. This paper reviews the relationship between the experimental and theoretical results on blob formation, dynamics and transport and assesses the degree to which blob theory and simulations can be compared and validated against experiments. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics},

@article{Scott1997a,
abstract = {A transcollisional, electromagnetic fluid model, incorporating the parallel heat Bur as a dependent variable, is constructed to treat electron drift turbulence in the regime of tokamak edge plasmas at the L-H transition. The resulting turbulence is very sensitive to the plasma beta throughout this regime, with the scaling with rising beta produced by the effect of magnetic induction to slow the Alfvenic parallel electron dynamics and thereby leave the turbulence in a more robust, non-adiabatic state, Magnetic flutter and curvature have a minor qualitative effect on the turbulence mode structure and on the beta scaling, even when their quantitative effect is strong. Transport by magnetic flutter is small compared to that by the E x B flow eddies. Fluctuation statistics show that while the turbulence shows no coherent structure, it is coupled strongly enough so that neither density nor temperature fluctuations behave as passive scalars. Both profile gradients drive the turbulence, with the total thermal energy transport varying only weakly with the gradient ratio, d log T/d log n. Scaling with magnetic shear is pronounced, with stronger shear leading to lower drive levels. Scaling with either collision frequency or magnetic curvature is weak, consistent with their weak qualitative effect. The result is that electron drift turbulence at L-H transition edge parameters is drift Alfven turbulence, with both ballooning and resistivity in a clear secondary role. The contents of the drift Alfven model will form a significant part of any useful first-principles computation of tokamak edge turbulence.},

abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means, Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Low-frequency electrostatic drift wave turbulence has been studied in both laboratory plasmas and in space. The present review describes a number of such laboratory experiments together with results obtained by instrumented spacecraft in the Earth's near and distant ionospheres. The summary emphasizes readily measurable quantities, such as the turbulent power spectra for the fluctuations in plasma density, potential and electric fields. The agreement between power spectra measured in the laboratory and in space seems to be acceptable, but there are sufficiently frequent counterexamples to justify a future dedicated analysis, for instance by numerical tools, to explain deviations. When interpreting spectra at low ionospheric altitudes, it is necessary to give attention to the DC ionospheric electric fields and the differences in the physics of electron–ion collisions and collisions of charged particles with neutrals for cases with significant Hall drifts. These effects modify the drift wave spectra. A dedicated laboratory experiment accounted for some of these differences.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The subtle kinematical effects of the latter are revealed through many illustrations. Finally, this insight is used to explain the physical mechanismbehind the ideal interchange instability.

abstract = {Numerical simulation of plasma turbulence in the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) [W. Gekelman, H. Pfister, Z. Lucky et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum.62, 2875 (1991)] is presented. The model, implemented in the BOUndary Turbulence code [M. Umansky, X. Xu, B. Dudson et al., Contrib. Plasma Phys.180, 887 (2009)], includes three-dimensional (3D) collisional fluid equations for plasma density, electron parallel momentum, and current continuity, and also includes the effects of ion-neutral collisions. In nonlinear simulations using measured LAPD density profiles but assuming constant temperature profile for simplicity, self-consistent evolution of instabilities and nonlinearly generated zonal flows results in a saturated turbulent state. Comparisons of these simulations with measurements in LAPD plasmas reveal good qualitative and reasonable quantitative agreement, in particular in frequency spectrum, spatial correlation, and amplitude probability distribution function of density fluctuations. For comparison with LAPD measurements, the plasma density profile in simulations is maintained either by direct azimuthal averaging on each time step, or by adding particle source/sink function. The inferred source/sink values are consistent with the estimated ionization source and parallel losses in LAPD. These simulations lay the groundwork for more a comprehensive effort to test fluid turbulence simulation against LAPD data.},

abstract = {Large-scale radial advection of isolated structures in nonuniformly magnetized plasmas is investigated. The underlying mechanism considered is due to the nonlinear evolution of interchange motions, without any presumption of plasma sheaths. Theoretical arguments supported by numerical simulations reveal an inertial scaling for the radial velocity of isolated structures in the ideal limit. This velocity increases as the square root of the structure size relative to the length scale of the magnetic field. The magnitude of the radial advection velocity, as well as the dynamical evolution of the structures, compares favorably with recent experimental measurements of radially propagating blob structures in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined plasmas.},

abstract = {Drift wave turbulence, in general a balance between E x B drift turbulence in planes perpendicular to, and dissipative wave dynamics parallel to, a background magnetic field, is a hallmark example of nonlinearity in plasma physics. The turbulence generally has the same basic character in a sheared magnetic field lying in closed surfaces whether linear instabilities are present or not. Only when the linear forcing terms are dominant does this situation not prevail; it is not analogous to neutral fluid turbulence where pure linear forcing is balanced by pure nonlinear mixing and decorrelation. Detailed computations show that two types of nonlinearity are simultaneously present: advection of fluid vorticity by the E x B flows, which tends to have a scattering character, and E x B advection of pressure disturbances, which has the familiar diffusive mixing character. The vorticity nonlinearity excites the turbulence, acting against the mostly linear parallel dynamics which constrains it, while the pressure nonlinearity provides dissipation via transfer to ever smaller scales. The practical result is that the saturated level of the turbulence and the resulting averaged thermal energy transport are controlled principally by these nonlinear mechanisms even when moderate linear instabilities are present. The model is mostly applicable to tokamak edge turbulence, for which the linear forcing effects are sufficiently moderate that the nonlinear physics is allowed to operate.},

abstract = {We present and discuss three discontinuous Galerkin (dG) discretizations for the anisotropic heat conduction equation on non-aligned cylindrical grids. Our non-aligned scheme relies on a self-adjoint local dG (LDG) discretization of the elliptic operator. It conserves the energy exactly and converges with arbitrary order. The pollution by numerical perpendicular heat fluxes decreases with superconvergence rates. We compare this scheme with aligned schemes that are based on the flux-coordinate independent approach for the discretization of parallel derivatives. Here, the dG method provides the necessary interpolation. The first aligned discretization can be used in an explicit time-integrator. However, the scheme violates conservation of energy and shows up stagnating convergence rates for very high resolutions. We overcome this partly by using the adjoint of the parallel derivative operator to construct a second self-adjoint aligned scheme. This scheme preserves energy, but reveals unphysical oscillations in the numerical tests, which result in a decreased order of convergence. Both aligned schemes exhibit low numerical heat fluxes into the perpendicular direction and are superior for flute-modes with finite parallel gradients. We build our argumentation on various numerical experiments on all three schemes for a general axisymmetric magnetic field, which is closed by a comparison to the aligned finite difference (FD) schemes of Stegmeir et al. (2014) and Stegmeir et al. (submitted for publication).},

abstract = {Graph coloring has been employed since the 1980s to efficiently compute sparse Jacobian and Hessian matrices using either finite differences or automatic differentiation. Several coloring problems occur in this context, depending on whether the matrix is a Jacobian or a Hessian, and on the specifics of the computational techniques employed. We consider eight variant vertex coloring problems here. This article begins with a gentle introduction to the problem of computing a sparse Jacobian, followed by an overview of the historical devel- opment of the research area. Then we present a unifying framework for the graph models of the variant matrix estimation problems. The framework is based upon the viewpoint that a partition of a matrix into structurally orthogonal groups of columns corresponds to distance-2 coloring an appropriate graph representation. The unified framework helps integrate earlier work and leads to fresh insights; enables the design of more efficient al- gorithms for many problems; leads to new algorithms for others; and eases the task of building graph models for new problems. We report computational results on two of the coloring problems to support our claims. Most of the methods for these problems treat a column or a row of a matrix as an atomic entity, and partition the columns or rows (or both). A brief review of methods that do not fit these criteria is provided. We also discuss results in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science that intersect with the topics considered here.},

abstract = {A finite-difference scheme for the direct simulation of the incompressible time-dependent three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in cylindrical coordinates is presented. The equations in primitive variables (vr,vtheta,vzandp) are solved by a fractional-step method together with an approximate-factorization technique. Cylindrical coordinates are singular at the axis; the introduction of the radial fluxqr=rmiddle dotvron a staggered grid simplifies the treatment of the region atr= 0. The method is tested by comparing the evolution of a free vortex ring and its collision with a wall with the theory, experiments, and other numerical results. The formation of a tripolar vortex, where the highest vorticity is atr= 0, is also considered. Finally to emphasize the accurate treatment near the axis, the motion of a Lamb dipole crossing the origin is simulated.},

abstract = {The dynamics of vortical structures in magnetized plasmas with nonuniform density is investigated numerically. In particular the dynamics of monopolar vortices is considered and the results are discussed in terms of the conservation of potential vorticity. It is found that individual vortex structures tend to transport density up the gradient in contrast to structures embedded in developed turbulence, which on the average will lead to a flattening of the density gradient. The role of vortical structures in connection with electrostatic plasma turbulence and the associated cross-field plasma transport is also addressed.},

Chaplygin's solutions include that of an elliptical patch of uniform vorticity in an exterior field of pure shear and that of a (symmetric or non-symmetric) dipolar vortex with a continuous distribution of vorticity translating steadily along a straight path. In addition, a solution is presented for a non-symmetric vortex dipole moving along a circular trajectory. A concise account of Chaplygin's solutions is given, complemented by a more detailed analysis of some of their relevant properties.},

abstract = {Aturbulent-generated azimuthally symmetric radially sheared plasma fluidflow is observed in a cylindrical magnetized helicon plasma device with no external sources of momentum input. A turbulent momentum conservation analysis shows that this shear flow is sustained against dissipation by the turbulent Reynolds stress generated by collisional drift fluctuations in the device. In the wavenumberdomainthis process is manifested via a nonlinear transfer of energy from small scales to larger scales. Simulations of collisional drift turbulence in this device have also been carried out and clearly showthe formation of a shear flowquantitatively similar to that observed experimentally. Theresults integrate experiment and first-principle simulations and validate the basic theoretical picture of drift-wave/shear flow interactions.},

@article{Helander1994,
abstract = {Transport coefficients and fluid equations in the limit of short mean free path are derived for a partially ionized plasma undergoing charge exchange, ionization, and recombination. The electron distribution is assumed to be unaffected by these processes and by collisions with neutral particles, and collisions among the neutrals are neglected. The calculated heat flux and viscosity contain terms purely related to charge exchange, and terms proportional to their usual counterparts in a completely ionized plasma with an additional proportionality factor equal to the inverse square of the fraction of ions in the plasma. The reason for this latter behavior is that charge exchange does not randomize particle trajectories, so that heavy particles suffer an ‘‘identity crisis'' by existing alternately as neutrals and ions. The use of a closer approximation to the charge‐exchange cross section than previously employed gives rise to new terms in the neutral momentum and energy equations, representing the thermal force and the diffusion thermoeffect. The latter contributes significantly to the total heat flux in the plasma.},

abstract = {BOUT++ is a 3D nonlinear finite-difference plasma simulation code, capable of solving quite general systems of PDEs, but targeted particularly on studies of the edge region of tokamak plasmas. BOUT++ is publicly available, and has been adopted by a growing number of researchers worldwide. Here we present improvements which have been made to the code since its original release, both in terms of structure and its capabilities. Some recent applications of these methods are reviewed, and areas of active development are discussed. We also present algorithms and tools which have been developed to enable creation of inputs from analytic expressions and experimental data, and for processing and visualisation of output results. This includes a new tool Hypnotoad for the creation of meshes from experimental equilibria. Algorithms have been implemented in BOUT++ to solve a range of linear algebraic problems encountered in the simulation of reduced MHD and gyro-fluid models: A preconditioning scheme is presented which enables the plasma potential to be calculated efficiently using iterative methods supplied by the PETSc library, without invoking the Boussinesq approximation. Scaling studies are also performed of a linear solver used as part of physics-based preconditioning to accelerate the convergence of implicit time-integration schemes.},

abstract = {Numerical fluid simulations of interchange turbulence for geometry and parameters relevant to the boundary region of magnetically confined plasmas are shown to result in intermittent transport qualitatively similar to recent experimental measurements. The two-dimensional simulation domain features a forcing region with spatially localized sources of particles and heat outside which losses due to the motion along open magnetic-field lines dominate, corresponding to the edge region and the scrape-off layer, respectively. Turbulent states reveal intermittent eruptions of hot plasma from the edge region, propagating radially far into the scrape-off layer in the form of field-aligned filaments, or blobs. This results in positively skewed and flattened single-point probability distribution functions of particle density and temperature, reflecting the frequent appearance of large fluctuations. The conditional fluctuation wave forms and transport statistics are also in a good agreement with those derived from the experiments. Associated with the turbulence bursts are relaxation oscillations in the particle and heat confinements as well as in the kinetic energy of the sheared poloidal flows. The formation of blob structures is thus related to profile variations, which are here triggered in a quasiperiodic manner by a global dynamical regulation due to the self-sustained sheared flows.},

abstract = {A new pressure formulation for splitting methods is developed that results in high-order time-accurate schemes for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, improved pressure boundary conditions of high order in time are introduced that minimize the effect of erroneous numerical boundary layers induced by splitting methods. A new family of stiffly stable schemes is employed in mixed explicit/implicit time-intgration rules. These schemes exhibit much broader stability regions as compared to Adams-family schemes, typically used in splitting methods. Their stability properties remain almost constant as the accuracy of the integration increases, so that robust third- or higher-order time-accurate schemes can readily be constructed that remain stable at relatively large CFL number. The new schemes are implemented within the framework of spectral element discretizations in space so that flexibility and accuracy is guaranteed in the numerical experimentation. A model Stokes problem is studied in detail, and several examples of Navier-Stokes solutions of flows in complex geometries are reported. Comparison is made with the previously used first-order in time spectral element splitting and non-splitting (e.g., Uzawa) schemes. High-order splitting/spectral element methods combine accuracy in space and time, and flexibility in geometry, and thus can be very efficient in direct simulations of turbulent flows in complex geometries.},

Several experimentally observed features of plasma turbulence are qualitatively reproduced, and quantitative agreement is achieved at the order-of-magnitude level. The calculated turbulencefluctuations have non-Gaussian characteristics, however the radial flux of plasma density is consistent with Bohm diffusion. Electric polarization of density blobs does not appear to play a significant role in the studied case. Turbulence spectra exhibit direct and inverse cascades in both azimuthal and axial wavenumbers and indicate coupling between the drift instability and Kelvin-Helmholtz mode.},

abstract = {In magnetically confined fusion experiments, turbulent transport dominates over collisional transport in the edge gradient region and in the scrape-off layer (SOL). Traditionally concepts as Fick's law are used to describe turbulent transport by effective diffusion coefficients and convective velocities. These concepts are only well founded if the transport exhibits Gaussian statistics. In the last decade it has become increasingly obvious this is not the case [E.T. Lu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74 (1995) 2511; D. Newman, B.A. Carreras, P. Diamond, T.S. Hahm, Phys. Plasmas 3 (1996) 1858]. Intermittency, long range correlations, and ballistic transport events are widely documented in the plasma edge. The latter are characterized by the radial propagation of coherent structures - usually referred to as blobs - carrying energy, current and particle density across magnetic field lines. This ultimately renders the description of transport by mere use of effective mean transport coefficients useless, as this does not account for the effects of frequent extreme events, which have strong, lasting, and possibly destructive influence on plasma facing components. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Plasma dynamics in cylindrical geometry, with many well diagnosed experiments in operation worldwide, is of fundamental interest. These linear machines can provide an unique testing ground for direct and detailed comparisons of numerical simulations of nonlinear plasma dynamics with experiments. Thus, it is possible to assess the reproductive and predictive capabilities of plasma simulations in unprecedented detail. Here, three-dimensional global fluid simulations of a cylindrical magnetized plasma are presented. This plasma is characterized by the existence of spatially localized sources and sinks. The traditional scale separation paradigm is not applied in the simulation model to account for the important evolution of the background profiles due to the dynamics of turbulent fluctuations. Furthermore, the fluid modeling of sheath boundary conditions, which determine the plasma conditions, are an important ingredient to the code presented here. The linear properties of the model equations are studied and are shown to agree well with experimental observations of linear drift modes. The fully nonlinear simulations are characterized by turbulent fluctuations, which are dominated by low mode numbers in the large radial pressure gradient region. In the far plasma edge, the fluctuations display an intermittent character due to convection within radially extended spatiotemporal potential fluctuations. This paper reports on the model and general code results, while the detailed comparison to a specific experiment is left to a follow-up paper. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The edge of the reversed field pinch experiment RFX-mod (R=2 m, a=0.46 m) is characterized by a complex magnetic topology and strong pressure gradients. A set of fast spectroscopic diagnostics has been designed to characterize both main plasma edge parameters and turbulence, including coherent structures (blobs) and radial profiles of the thermodynamic variables. Measurements of the edge radial profiles of electron density (n(e)), temperature (T(e)), and pressure (P(e)) are obtained by a thermal helium beam diagnostic, which locally measures the ratios of the spectral lines emitted by a neutral He cloud puffed into hydrogen plasma discharges. A gas puff imaging system allows the high frequency (1 MHz bandwidth) measurement of the fluctuations of He I emissivity in the same positions. The system measures both the intermittent behavior of the edge turbulence and n(e), T(e), and P(e) profiles of the corresponding coherent structures, with a resolution down to 6 {\{}{\$}{\}}\backslashmu{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}s. The optical diagnostics are complemented by a set of triaxial magnetic coils to simultaneously characterize the edge magnetic field.},

abstract = {The scalings of correlation lengths and times with the drift-scale parameter p(s) and other dimensionless parameters are investigated. Using a novel 8x8 Langmuir probe matrix, the two-dimensional structure of drift-wave turbulence has been measured inside the confinement region of the toroidal low-temperature plasma in the TJ-K torsatron [N. Krause et al., Rev. Sci. Instrum. 73, 3474 (2002)]. Using five different gases from hydrogen to argon, p(s) could be varied by a factor of 10. For small ion masses, the scalings of the microscopic parameters turn out to be close to the predictions from drift-wave turbulence, which lead to a gyro-Bohm scaling of the diffusivity. Including heavier ions turns the scaling to more Bohm-like. It is shown that p(s) scaling studies carried out on the diffusivity can be misleading if residual dependencies on other parameters are present and the cross phase between poloidal electric field and density fluctuations is not constant as in the present case. The measured turbulent diffusivity is consistent with typical values reported for the edge of fusion plasmas. (C) 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Experimental results from a magnetized argon plasma column demonstrate a controlled transition to a turbulent state as the magnetic field (B) strength is increased. At lower B there is an onset of fluctuations in density and potential. These are shown to be due to drift waves that have been modified by flow shear. As B is increased the character of the fluctuations undergoes several changes. These changes include a general decrease of coherence, an increase in the phase lag (between density and potential), and a straightening of the observed dispersion relation. Concomitantly, the intensifying and broadening fluctuation spectra lead to significant cross-field radial particle transport. Other nonlinear dynamical activity is inferred during the transition, e.g., three-wave interactions, the formation of localized structures (that do not significantly contribute to the net particle transport), and energy transfer to the largest available scales. },

The origins of drift waves, transition to drift turbulence and drift turbulence–zonal flow interactions in open field line and toroidal closed flux surface experiments are discussed and the free energy sources, dissipation mechanisms and nonlinear dynamics of drift turbulence in the core, edge and scrape-off layer plasma regions are examined. Evidence that turbulence across these regions is linked and that turbulence-driven zonal flows exist is presented, and evidence that these flows help regulate the turbulent scale lengths, amplitude and fluxes is summarized. Seemingly contradictory reports exist regarding the scale of turbulent transport events; gyro-Bohm behavior of turbulence correlation lengths as well as evidence for long-range transport phenomena both exist. Changes in turbulence during and after transport barrier formation are summarized and compared. The inferred turbulent particle and heat fluxes due to turbulent transport are usually consistent with global confinement, and edge plasma momentum transport appears to be linked to plasma flows at the last-closed flux surface and in the open field line region. However, inconsistencies between observed transport and turbulence have sometimes been reported and are pointed out here. Special attention is given to open issues, and suggestions for future experimental studies are given.},

Comparing numerical and experimental frequencies, it is found that the experimentally observed frequencies are consistent with drift waves.

Magnum-PSI will be a highly accessible laboratory experiment in which the interaction of magnetized plasma with different surfaces can be studied. This experiment will provide new insights in the complex physics and chemistry that will occur in the divertor region of the future experimental fusion reactor ITER. Here, extremely high power and particle flux densities are predicted at relatively low plasma temperatures. Magnum-PSI will be able to simulate these detached ITER divertor conditions in detail. In addition, conditions can be varied over a wide range, such as different target materials, plasma temperatures, beam diameters, particle fluxes, inclination angles of target, background pressures, magnetic fields, etc., making Magnum-PSI an excellent test bed for high heat flux components of future fusion reactors. The design phase of the Magnum-PSI device has been completed. The construction and assembly phase of the device is in progress. In this contribution, we will present the design and construction of the Magnum-PSI experiment. The status of the vacuum system, the 3T superconducting magnet, the plasma source, the target plate and manipulator, and additional plasma heating will be presented.

abstract = {An experimental investigation of the low-frequency density fluctuations in the plasma edge region of the TJ-K stellarator [N. Krause , Rev. Sci. Inst. 73, 3474 (2002)] finds that the ensemble-averaged frequency spectra exhibit a near exponential frequency dependence whose origin can be traced to individual pulses having a Lorentzian temporal shape. Similar features have been previously observed [D. C. Pace , Phys. Plasmas 15, 122304 (2008)] in a linear magnetized device under conditions in which cross-field pressure gradients are present. The reported observation of such features within the turbulent environment of a toroidal confinement device provides support for the conjecture that the underlying processes are a general feature of pressure gradients. Also presented is the magnetic field strength dependence of the pulse widths and the waiting time distribution between pulses. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. [doi:10.1063/1.3622679]},

abstract = {The spontaneous generation of large-scale flows by the rectification of small-scale turbulent fluctuations is of great importance both in geophysical flows and in magnetically confined plasmas. These flows regulate the turbulence and may set up effective transport barriers. In the present contribution the generation of zonal flows will be illustrated in a simple fluid experiment performed in a rotating container with radial symmetric bottom topography. An effective mixing that homogenizes the potential vorticity in the fluid layer will lead to the replacement of the high-potential vorticity near the centre with low potential vorticity from the outside, which will imply the formation of a large-scale flow. The experimental results are supported by direct numerical solutions of the quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation in the $\beta$-plane approximation modelling the experimental situation. The analogy to large-scale flow generation in drift-wave turbulence dynamics in magnetized plasma is briefly discussed.},

The exposition is mostly neutral to the spatial discretization technique, but we cover the need for staggered grids or mixed finite elements and outline some alternative stabilization techniques that allow using standard grids.

These schemes are widely used, simulating, e.g., neutral and plasma flows. FD schemes have long been considered fast, relatively easy to implement, and applicable to complex geometries, but are somewhat inferior in accuracy compared to spectral schemes. Using two study cases at high Reynolds number, the merging of two equally signed Gaussian vortices in a periodic box and dipole interaction with a no-slip wall, we will demonstrate that the accuracy of FD schemes can be significantly improved if one is careful in choosing an appropriate FD scheme that reflects conservation properties of the nonlinear terms and in setting up the grid in accordance with the problem.},

The plasma presents a wave turbulence characterized by a limited number of developing modes. To study the link between mode dynamics and particle transport, frequency-dependent time evolution of transport is obtained by applying complex continuous wavelet decomposition on spatio-temporal data from electrostatic probes. The method is shown to recover transport description consistent with other analysis methods for a weakly turbulent state. For a plasma state featuring a large non-sinusoidal structure, the time evolution of transport on the second harmonic of the main fluctuation shows a slow modulation of azimuthal mode number m{\^{A}} ={\^{A}} 0 with similarities to a zonal perturbation.},

These determine the combinations which must appear under derivatives in the moment equations so that not only thermal free energy but also its combination with the {\{}{\{}{\}}E×B{\{}{\}}{\}} energy is properly conserved by the parallel and perpendicular compressional effects. The resulting system exhibits the same qualitative energy-transfer properties as corresponding Braginskii or Landau fluid models. One clear result is that the numerical model built on these equations is well behaved for arbitrarily large perpendicular wave number, allowing exploration of two scale phenomena linking dynamics at the ion and electron gyroradii. When the numerical formulation is done in the globally consistent flux tube model, the results with adiabatic electrons are consistent with the {\{}{\{}{\}}“Cyclone{\{}{\}}{\}} base case” results of gyrokinetic models.},

abstract = {For drift wave turbulence, due to charge conservation, the divergence of the parallel current is coupled to the divergence of the perpendicular polarization current, which determines the effective radial momentum flux, i.e., the Reynolds stress. Changes in the current flow patterns also affect the nonlinear energy transfer from smaller to larger scales. Here, we show that by changing the end plate boundary conditions in a cylindrical plasma device, the radial currents through the plasma and hence the net momentum transport and the nonlinear coupling for the inverse energy transfer are strongly modified. The transition to drift wave turbulence and the formation of low frequency zonal flows can be either suppressed with conducting boundaries or enhanced with insulating boundaries.

A wealth of information obtained from quasistationary laboratory experiments for plasma confinement is reviewed for drift waves driven unstable by density gradients, temperature gradients and trapped particle effects. The modern understanding of Bohm transport and the role of sheared flows and magnetic shear in reducing the transport to the gyro-Bohm rate are explained and illustrated with large scale computer simulations. The types of mixed wave and vortex turbulence spontaneously generated in nonuniform plasmas are derived with reduced magnetized fluid descriptions. The types of theoretical descriptions reviewed include weak turbulence theory, Kolmogorov anisotropic spectral indices, and the mixing length. A number of standard turbulent diffusivity formulas are given for the various space-time scales of the drift-wave turbulent mixing.},

This paper presents recent advances in the scalable solution of nonlinear partial differential equations in BOUT++, with emphasis on simulations of edge localized modes in tokamaks. A six-field, nonlinear, reduced magnetohydrodynamics model containing the fast shear Alfven wave and electron and ion heat conduction along magnetic fields is solved by using Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods and nonlinear GMRES (NGMRES). Physics-based preconditioning based on analytic Schur factorization of a simplified Jacobian is found to result in an order of magnitude reduction in runtime over unpreconditioned JFNK, and NGMRES is shown to significantly reduce runtime while requiring only the nonlinear function evaluation. We describe in detail the preconditioning algorithm, and we discuss parallel performance of NGMRES and Newton-Krylov methods using the PETSc library.},

abstract = {A review of physical mechanisms of the rogue wave phenomenon is given. The data of marine observations as well as laboratory experiments are briefly discussed. They demonstrate that freak waves may appear in deep and shallow waters. Simple statistical analysis of the rogue wave probability based on the assumption of a Gaussian wave field is reproduced. In the context of water wave theories the probabilistic approach shows that numerical simulations of freak waves should be made for very long times on large spatial domains and large number of realizations. As linear models of freak waves the following mechanisms are considered: dispersion enhancement of transient wave groups, geometrical focusing in basins of variable depth, and wave-current interaction. Taking into account nonlinearity of the water waves, these mechanisms remain valid but should be modified. Also, the influence of the nonlinear modulational instability (Benjamin-Feir instability) on the rogue wave occurence is discussed. Specific numerical simulations were performed in the framework of classical nonlinear evolution equations: the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, the Davey-Stewartson system, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, the Zakharov equation, and the fully nonlinear potential equations.

abstract = {Turbulence in magnetized plasma, with particle gyroradii that are small compared to the device size, consists of 2-D dynamically incompressible fluidlike turbulence in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field and of compressible wavelike dynamics parallel to it. A strong anisotropy between the perpendicular and parallel scales of motion results. The natural coordinates are, therefore, those which follow the field lines. The deformational issues which result from the magnetic shear and variation of the distance between the magnetic flux surfaces with a position are treated by judicious choices of the coordinate representation. We elucidate the methods by which, in turn, the deformation induced by the shear and, then, by the shaping is remedied. Both the physical and computational considerations are treated since the grid isotropicity best represents the small-scale turbulence and, at the same time, facilitates the multigrid solution of the elliptic equations which are part of the overall system. We present the details of the conformal coordinate system and its implementation, together with an example of its calculation for a realistic tokamak equilibrium case.},

Several advantages of this approach are presented.

abstract = {Theone-dimensional fluid codeSOLF1Dhas been used for modelling of plasma transport in the scrape-off layer (SOL) along magnetic field lines, both in steady state and under transient conditions that arise due to plasma turbulence. The presented work summarizes results of SOLF1D with attention given to transient parallel transport which reveals two distinct time scales due to the transport mechanisms of convection and diffusion. Time-dependent modelling combined with the effect of ballooning shows propagation of particles along the magnetic field line with Mach number up to M ≈ 1 and supersonic transport when plasma–neutral interactions are not present. Asymmetric heat and particle fluxes are analysed for a case with poloidally asymmetric radial outflow(ballooning) and for a radial outflowwith parallelmomentum(rotation). In addition, parallel damping of the density and electron temperature calculated in SOLF1D is compared with the approximative model used in the turbulence code ESEL both for steady-state and turbulent SOL. Dynamics of the parallel transport are investigated for a simple transient event simulating the propagation of particles and energy to the targets from a blob passing across the flux tube at the outboard midplane and for more complex time-dependent data provided by ESEL.},

abstract = {, new order in plasma turbulence, in which chained structure formation is realized by cross-interaction turbulence is " Panta Rhei -everything flows and nothing lasts (Heraclitus) " , is true in our universe, because one structure that decays is generated after another. The variety of scalar and vector fields in nature is formed by plasma tur-bulence 1 . Drift-wave fluctuations 2 , which are excited by density gradient in magnetized plasmas, play impor-tant roles in turbulent structure formation in laboratory plasmas (such as for fusion-oriented research). Drift waves drive cross-field flux to generate, e.g. zonal flows and zonal magnetic fields, which circumnavigate the main magnetic field 1,3,4 . On the other hand, the sheared flow in the direction of magnetic fields is predicted to cause Kelvin-Helmholtz type instability 5 (D' Angelo mode 6). This instability is considered to be a key element in understanding the turbulent transport in space plasmas. Both drift wave and D' Angelo mode fluctuations induce cross-field fluxes of particle and momentum, and the interferences and competition between gradients of different fields (density, azimuthal and axial velocities) take place 1,2,5,7,8 . (Concerning the flow-shear driven mode, although it was identified experimentally 5,9,10 , direct interference between particle and density fluxes asso-ciated with this mode has not been measured.) Thus, there is a central problem, i.e., what would happen if both the pressure-gradient driven turbulence and flow-shear-driven turbulence coexist simultaneously? How does it impact structural formation in extremely non-equilibrium plasmas? Here we report the discovery of a new order in cross-ferroic turbulence, in which chained structure formation is realized by cross-interaction between different inhomogeneities of scalar and vector fields. Drift-wave fluctuations cause cross-field flux of momentum, which enhances the velocity gradient. The enhanced velocity gradient excites Kelvin-Helmholtz type instability, which causes an up-hill flux of particles in the strong-velocity-shear region. The causal relation in the compet-ing structure formations is identified, by measuring the relaxation rate and dissipation power in the complex turbulence-driven flux.},

abstract = {The charge exchange recombination spectroscopy (CXRS) diagnostics at ASDEX Upgrade (AUG) have been upgraded and extended to provide high-resolution measurements of impurity ion temperature, density, and rotation profiles. The existing core toroidal CXRS diagnostic has been refurbished to increase the level of signal, thus enabling shorter exposure times down to 3.5 ms. Additional lines of sight provide more detailed profiles and enable simultaneous measurements of multiple impurities. In addition, a new CXRS system has been installed, which allows for the measurement of poloidal impurity ion rotation in the plasma edge with high temporal (1.9 ms) and spatial resolution (down to 5 mm). A new wavelength correction method has been implemented to perform in situ wavelength calibrations on a shot-to-shot basis. Absolute measurements of the poloidal impurity ion rotation with uncertainties smaller than 1.5 km/s have been obtained. Comparison of all the CXRS measurements provides a consistency check of the diagnostics and good agreement has been found for all of the CXRS systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, He's variational iteration method is applied to obtain exact solutions of some nonlinear diffusion equations. The variational iteration method is used to construct correction functionals using general Lagrange multipliers identified optimally via the variational theory, and the initial approximations can be freely chosen with unknown constants. The solutions obtained are compared with those obtained by the Adomian decomposition method and homotopy perturbation method, showing excellent agreement, but the variational iteration method is more effective. He's variational iteration method can be introduced to overcome the difficulties arising in calculating Adomian polynomials.},

@article{Scott2005a,
abstract = {The details of fluctuation free energy conservation in the gyrofluid model are examined. The polarisation equation relates ExB flow and eddy energy to combinations of the potential and the density and perpendicular temperature. These determine the combinations which must appear under derivatives in the moment equations so that not only thermal free energy but its combination with the ExB energy is properly conserved by parallel and perpendicular compressional effects. The resulting system exhibits the same qualitative energy transfer properties as corresponding Braginskii or Landau fluid models. One clear result is that the numerical model built on these equations is well behaved for arbitrarily large perpendicular wavenumber, allowing exploration of two scale phenomena linking dynamics at the ion and electron gyroradii. When the numerical formulation is done in the globally consistent flux tube model, the results with adiabatic electrons are consistent with the ``Cyclone Base Case'' results of gyrokinetic models.},

abstract = {The origin of intermittent fluctuations in the plasma edge of a linearly magnetized plasma column is investigated and closely compared with three-dimensional global numerical simulations. The intermittent character is caused by radially propagating turbulent structures. The radial propagation of the structures is due to the self-consistent potential perturbation associated with them. Their formation is closely linked to transport events caused by nonlinear drift-wave fluctuations. In the formation region a sheared azimuthal flow velocity is observed, which is driven by the Reynolds stress.},
