abstract = {The boundary plasma turbulence code BOUT models tokamak boundary-plasma turbulence in a realistic divertor geometry using modified Braginskii equations for plasma vorticity, density (n(i)), electron and ion temperature (T(e), T(j)) and parallel momenta. The BOUT code solves for the plasma fluid equations in a three dimensional (3D) toroidal segment (or a toroidal wedge), including the region somewhat inside the separatrix and extending into the scrape-off layer; the private flux region is also included. In this paper, a description is given of the sophisticated physical models, innovative numerical algorithms, and modern software design used to simulate edge-plasmas in magnetic fusion energy devices. The BOUT code's unique capabilities and functionality are exemplified via simulations of the impact of plasma density oil tokamak edge turbulence and blob dynamics.},

abstract = {While the reduced particle and fluid descriptions of magnetized plasma dynamics are based on the same set of approximations they apparently give differing results for the collective motions in non-uniform magnetic fields. Here it is shown that these two pictures give identical results when the diamagnetic effects due to chargedparticle gyration are taken into account. The subtle kinematical effects of the latter are revealed through many illustrations. Finally, this insight is used to explain the physical mechanismbehind the ideal interchange instability. All these topics are intimately connected and have so far not been given an adequate presentation in introductory textbooks. 1.

abstract = {In the limit of a small Debye length ( lambda D to 0) the analysis$\backslash$nof the plasma boundary layer leads to a two-scale problem of a collision$\backslash$nfree sheath and of a quasi-neutral presheath. Bohm's criterion expresses$\backslash$na necessary condition for the formation of a stationary sheath in$\backslash$nfront of a negative absorbing wall. The basic features of the plasma-sheath$\backslash$ntransition and their relation to the Bohm criterion are discussed$\backslash$nand illustrated from a simple cold-ion fluid model. A rigorous kinetic$\backslash$nanalysis of the vicinity of the sheath edge allows one to generalize$\backslash$nBohm's criterion accounting not only for arbitrary ion and electron$\backslash$ndistributions, but also for general boundary conditions at the wall.$\backslash$nIt is shown that the generalized sheath condition is (apart from$\backslash$nspecial exceptions) marginally fulfilled and related to a sheath$\backslash$nedge field singularity. Due to this singularity, smooth matching$\backslash$nof the presheath and sheath solutions requires an additional transition$\backslash$nlayer. Previous investigations concerning particular problems of$\backslash$nthe plasma-sheath transition are reviewed in the light of the general$\backslash$nrelations.},

The variational iteration method is used to construct correction functionals using general Lagrange multipliers identified optimally via the variational theory, and the initial approximations can be freely chosen with unknown constants. The solutions obtained are compared with those obtained by the Adomian decomposition method and homotopy perturbation method, showing excellent agreement, but the variational iteration method is more effective. He's variational iteration method can be introduced to overcome the difficulties arising in calculating Adomian polynomials.},

We demonstrate that floating potential fluctuations measured by a Langmuir probe are dominated by plasma electron temperature rather than potential. Spatial and temporal scales are found consistent with expectations based on interchange-driven turbulence. Conditionally averaged signals found for both potential and density are also consistent; however, those for temperature show an unexpected {\~{}}4 mm wide decrease by 10{\%} at the very centre of a blob.

abstract = {Turbulence in magnetized plasma, with particle gyroradii that are small compared to the device size, consists of 2-D dynamically incompressible fluidlike turbulence in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field and of compressible wavelike dynamics parallel to it. A strong anisotropy between the perpendicular and parallel scales of motion results. The natural coordinates are, therefore, those which follow the field lines. The deformational issues which result from the magnetic shear and variation of the distance between the magnetic flux surfaces with a position are treated by judicious choices of the coordinate representation. We elucidate the methods by which, in turn, the deformation induced by the shear and, then, by the shaping is remedied. Both the physical and computational considerations are treated since the grid isotropicity best represents the small-scale turbulence and, at the same time, facilitates the multigrid solution of the elliptic equations which are part of the overall system. We present the details of the conformal coordinate system and its implementation, together with an example of its calculation for a realistic tokamak equilibrium case.},

@article{Naulin2007,
abstract = {In magnetically confined fusion experiments, turbulent transport dominates over collisional transport in the edge gradient region and in the scrape-off layer (SOL). Traditionally concepts as Fick's law are used to describe turbulent transport by effective diffusion coefficients and convective velocities. These concepts are only well founded if the transport exhibits Gaussian statistics. In the last decade it has become increasingly obvious this is not the case [E.T. Lu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 74 (1995) 2511; D. Newman, B.A. Carreras, P. Diamond, T.S. Hahm, Phys. Plasmas 3 (1996) 1858]. Intermittency, long range correlations, and ballistic transport events are widely documented in the plasma edge. The latter are characterized by the radial propagation of coherent structures - usually referred to as blobs - carrying energy, current and particle density across magnetic field lines. This ultimately renders the description of transport by mere use of effective mean transport coefficients useless, as this does not account for the effects of frequent extreme events, which have strong, lasting, and possibly destructive influence on plasma facing components. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Karniadakis1991,
abstract = {A new pressure formulation for splitting methods is developed that results in high-order time-accurate schemes for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, improved pressure boundary conditions of high order in time are introduced that minimize the effect of erroneous numerical boundary layers induced by splitting methods. A new family of stiffly stable schemes is employed in mixed explicit/implicit time-intgration rules. These schemes exhibit much broader stability regions as compared to Adams-family schemes, typically used in splitting methods. Their stability properties remain almost constant as the accuracy of the integration increases, so that robust third- or higher-order time-accurate schemes can readily be constructed that remain stable at relatively large CFL number. The new schemes are implemented within the framework of spectral element discretizations in space so that flexibility and accuracy is guaranteed in the numerical experimentation. A model Stokes problem is studied in detail, and several examples of Navier-Stokes solutions of flows in complex geometries are reported. Comparison is made with the previously used first-order in time spectral element splitting and non-splitting (e.g., Uzawa) schemes. High-order splitting/spectral element methods combine accuracy in space and time, and flexibility in geometry, and thus can be very efficient in direct simulations of turbulent flows in complex geometries.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider a conservative discretization of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. We propose an extension of Arakawa's classical finite difference scheme for fluid flow in the vorticity–stream function formulation to a high order discontinuous Galerkin approximation. In addition, we show numerical simulations that demonstrate the accuracy of the scheme and verify the conservation properties, which are essential for long time integration. Furthermore, we discuss the massively parallel implementation on graphic processing units.},

Chaplygin's solutions include that of an elliptical patch of uniform vorticity in an exterior field of pure shear and that of a (symmetric or non-symmetric) dipolar vortex with a continuous distribution of vorticity translating steadily along a straight path. In addition, a solution is presented for a non-symmetric vortex dipole moving along a circular trajectory. A concise account of Chaplygin's solutions is given, complemented by a more detailed analysis of some of their relevant properties.},

The equations in primitive variables (vr,vtheta,vzandp) are solved by a fractional-step method together with an approximate-factorization technique. Cylindrical coordinates are singular at the axis; the introduction of the radial fluxqr=rmiddle dotvron a staggered grid simplifies the treatment of the region atr= 0. The method is tested by comparing the evolution of a free vortex ring and its collision with a wall with the theory, experiments, and other numerical results. The formation of a tripolar vortex, where the highest vorticity is atr= 0, is also considered. Finally to emphasize the accurate treatment near the axis, the motion of a Lamb dipole crossing the origin is simulated.},

@article{Scott2002,
abstract = {Drift wave turbulence, in general a balance between E x B drift turbulence in planes perpendicular to, and dissipative wave dynamics parallel to, a background magnetic field, is a hallmark example of nonlinearity in plasma physics. The turbulence generally has the same basic character in a sheared magnetic field lying in closed surfaces whether linear instabilities are present or not. Only when the linear forcing terms are dominant does this situation not prevail; it is not analogous to neutral fluid turbulence where pure linear forcing is balanced by pure nonlinear mixing and decorrelation. Detailed computations show that two types of nonlinearity are simultaneously present: advection of fluid vorticity by the E x B flows, which tends to have a scattering character, and E x B advection of pressure disturbances, which has the familiar diffusive mixing character. The vorticity nonlinearity excites the turbulence, acting against the mostly linear parallel dynamics which constrains it, while the pressure nonlinearity provides dissipation via transfer to ever smaller scales. The practical result is that the saturated level of the turbulence and the resulting averaged thermal energy transport are controlled principally by these nonlinear mechanisms even when moderate linear instabilities are present. The model is mostly applicable to tokamak edge turbulence, for which the linear forcing effects are sufficiently moderate that the nonlinear physics is allowed to operate.},

These schemes are widely used, simulating, e.g., neutral and plasma flows. FD schemes have long been considered fast, relatively easy to implement, and applicable to complex geometries, but are somewhat inferior in accuracy compared to spectral schemes. Using two study cases at high Reynolds number, the merging of two equally signed Gaussian vortices in a periodic box and dipole interaction with a no-slip wall, we will demonstrate that the accuracy of FD schemes can be significantly improved if one is careful in choosing an appropriate FD scheme that reflects conservation properties of the nonlinear terms and in setting up the grid in accordance with the problem.},

abstract = {Plasma dynamics in cylindrical geometry, with many well diagnosed experiments in operation worldwide, is of fundamental interest. These linear machines can provide an unique testing ground for direct and detailed comparisons of numerical simulations of nonlinear plasma dynamics with experiments. Thus, it is possible to assess the reproductive and predictive capabilities of plasma simulations in unprecedented detail. Here, three-dimensional global fluid simulations of a cylindrical magnetized plasma are presented. This plasma is characterized by the existence of spatially localized sources and sinks. The traditional scale separation paradigm is not applied in the simulation model to account for the important evolution of the background profiles due to the dynamics of turbulent fluctuations. Furthermore, the fluid modeling of sheath boundary conditions, which determine the plasma conditions, are an important ingredient to the code presented here. The linear properties of the model equations are studied and are shown to agree well with experimental observations of linear drift modes. The fully nonlinear simulations are characterized by turbulent fluctuations, which are dominated by low mode numbers in the large radial pressure gradient region. In the far plasma edge, the fluctuations display an intermittent character due to convection within radially extended spatiotemporal potential fluctuations. This paper reports on the model and general code results, while the detailed comparison to a specific experiment is left to a follow-up paper. (c) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Excellent agreement is found for both the radial variation of statistical moments and temporal correlations, clearly indicating that turbulent transport in the tokamak SOL is due to radial advection of blob-like filamentary structures. This offers an explanation both for the basic mechanism driving the anomalous SOL particle transport and the now commonly observed broad particle density profiles, extending deep into theSOLand thought to be the cause of high levels of main chamber plasma-wall interactions.},

abstract = {Numerical fluid simulations of interchange turbulence for geometry and parameters relevant to the boundary region of magnetically confined plasmas are shown to result in intermittent transport qualitatively similar to recent experimental measurements. The two-dimensional simulation domain features a forcing region with spatially localized sources of particles and heat outside which losses due to the motion along open magnetic-field lines dominate, corresponding to the edge region and the scrape-off layer, respectively. Turbulent states reveal intermittent eruptions of hot plasma from the edge region, propagating radially far into the scrape-off layer in the form of field-aligned filaments, or blobs. This results in positively skewed and flattened single-point probability distribution functions of particle density and temperature, reflecting the frequent appearance of large fluctuations. The conditional fluctuation wave forms and transport statistics are also in a good agreement with those derived from the experiments. Associated with the turbulence bursts are relaxation oscillations in the particle and heat confinements as well as in the kinetic energy of the sheared poloidal flows. The formation of blob structures is thus related to profile variations, which are here triggered in a quasiperiodic manner by a global dynamical regulation due to the self-sustained sheared flows.},

Additional lines of sight provide more detailed profiles and enable simultaneous measurements of multiple impurities. In addition, a new CXRS system has been installed, which allows for the measurement of poloidal impurity ion rotation in the plasma edge with high temporal (1.9 ms) and spatial resolution (down to 5 mm). A new wavelength correction method has been implemented to perform in situ wavelength calibrations on a shot-to-shot basis. Absolute measurements of the poloidal impurity ion rotation with uncertainties smaller than 1.5 km/s have been obtained. Comparison of all the CXRS measurements provides a consistency check of the diagnostics and good agreement has been found for all of the CXRS systems.},

abstract = {Transport coefficients and fluid equations in the limit of short mean free path are derived for a partially ionized plasma undergoing charge exchange, ionization, and recombination. The electron distribution is assumed to be unaffected by these processes and by collisions with neutral particles, and collisions among the neutrals are neglected. The calculated heat flux and viscosity contain terms purely related to charge exchange, and terms proportional to their usual counterparts in a completely ionized plasma with an additional proportionality factor equal to the inverse square of the fraction of ions in the plasma. The reason for this latter behavior is that charge exchange does not randomize particle trajectories, so that heavy particles suffer an ‘‘identity crisis'' by existing alternately as neutrals and ions. The use of a closer approximation to the charge‐exchange cross section than previously employed gives rise to new terms in the neutral momentum and energy equations, representing the thermal force and the diffusion thermoeffect. The latter contributes significantly to the total heat flux in the plasma.},

abstract = {The proper boundary conditions at the magnetic presheath entrance for plasma fluid turbulence models based on the drift approximation are derived, focusing on a weakly collisional plasma sheath with Ti≪Te and a magnetic field oblique to a totally absorbing wall. First, the location of the magnetic presheath entrance is rigorously derived. Then boundary conditions at the magnetic presheath entrance are analytically deduced for v||i, v||e, n, ϕ, Te, and for the vorticity $\omega$ = ∇⊥2ϕ. The effects of E × B and diamagnetic drifts on the boundary conditions are also investigated. Kinetic simulations are performed that confirm the analytical results. Finally, the new set of boundary conditions is implemented in a three-dimensional global fluid code for the simulation of plasma turbulence and, as an example, the results of a tokamak scrape-off layer simulation are discussed. The framework presented can be generalized to obtain boundary conditions at the magnetic presheath entrance in more complex scenarios.},

@article{Held2016,
abstract = {We present and discuss three discontinuous Galerkin (dG) discretizations for the anisotropic heat conduction equation on non-aligned cylindrical grids. Our non-aligned scheme relies on a self-adjoint local dG (LDG) discretization of the elliptic operator. It conserves the energy exactly and converges with arbitrary order. The pollution by numerical perpendicular heat fluxes decreases with superconvergence rates. We compare this scheme with aligned schemes that are based on the flux-coordinate independent approach for the discretization of parallel derivatives. Here, the dG method provides the necessary interpolation. The first aligned discretization can be used in an explicit time-integrator. However, the scheme violates conservation of energy and shows up stagnating convergence rates for very high resolutions. We overcome this partly by using the adjoint of the parallel derivative operator to construct a second self-adjoint aligned scheme. This scheme preserves energy, but reveals unphysical oscillations in the numerical tests, which result in a decreased order of convergence. Both aligned schemes exhibit low numerical heat fluxes into the perpendicular direction and are superior for flute-modes with finite parallel gradients. We build our argumentation on various numerical experiments on all three schemes for a general axisymmetric magnetic field, which is closed by a comparison to the aligned finite difference (FD) schemes of Stegmeir et al. (2014) and Stegmeir et al. (submitted for publication).},

abstract = {Theone-dimensional fluid codeSOLF1Dhas been used for modelling of plasma transport in the scrape-off layer (SOL) along magnetic field lines, both in steady state and under transient conditions that arise due to plasma turbulence. The presented work summarizes results of SOLF1D with attention given to transient parallel transport which reveals two distinct time scales due to the transport mechanisms of convection and diffusion. Time-dependent modelling combined with the effect of ballooning shows propagation of particles along the magnetic field line with Mach number up to M ≈ 1 and supersonic transport when plasma–neutral interactions are not present. Asymmetric heat and particle fluxes are analysed for a case with poloidally asymmetric radial outflow(ballooning) and for a radial outflowwith parallelmomentum(rotation). In addition, parallel damping of the density and electron temperature calculated in SOLF1D is compared with the approximative model used in the turbulence code ESEL both for steady-state and turbulent SOL. Dynamics of the parallel transport are investigated for a simple transient event simulating the propagation of particles and energy to the targets from a blob passing across the flux tube at the outboard midplane and for more complex time-dependent data provided by ESEL.},

abstract = {A review of physical mechanisms of the rogue wave phenomenon is given. The data of marine observations as well as laboratory experiments are briefly discussed. They demonstrate that freak waves may appear in deep and shallow waters. Simple statistical analysis of the rogue wave probability based on the assumption of a Gaussian wave field is reproduced. In the context of water wave theories the probabilistic approach shows that numerical simulations of freak waves should be made for very long times on large spatial domains and large number of realizations. As linear models of freak waves the following mechanisms are considered: dispersion enhancement of transient wave groups, geometrical focusing in basins of variable depth, and wave-current interaction. Taking into account nonlinearity of the water waves, these mechanisms remain valid but should be modified. Also, the influence of the nonlinear modulational instability (Benjamin-Feir instability) on the rogue wave occurence is discussed. Specific numerical simulations were performed in the framework of classical nonlinear evolution equations: the nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation, the Davey-Stewartson system, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, the Zakharov equation, and the fully nonlinear potential equations. Their results show the main features of the physical mechanisms of rogue wave phenomenon. {\textcopyright} 2003 {\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.},

In the wavenumberdomainthis process is manifested via a nonlinear transfer of energy from small scales to larger scales. Simulations of collisional drift turbulence in this device have also been carried out and clearly showthe formation of a shear flowquantitatively similar to that observed experimentally.

abstract = {A transcollisional, electromagnetic fluid model, incorporating the parallel heat Bur as a dependent variable, is constructed to treat electron drift turbulence in the regime of tokamak edge plasmas at the L-H transition. The resulting turbulence is very sensitive to the plasma beta throughout this regime, with the scaling with rising beta produced by the effect of magnetic induction to slow the Alfvenic parallel electron dynamics and thereby leave the turbulence in a more robust, non-adiabatic state, Magnetic flutter and curvature have a minor qualitative effect on the turbulence mode structure and on the beta scaling, even when their quantitative effect is strong. Transport by magnetic flutter is small compared to that by the E x B flow eddies. Fluctuation statistics show that while the turbulence shows no coherent structure, it is coupled strongly enough so that neither density nor temperature fluctuations behave as passive scalars. Both profile gradients drive the turbulence, with the total thermal energy transport varying only weakly with the gradient ratio, d log T/d log n. Scaling with magnetic shear is pronounced, with stronger shear leading to lower drive levels. Scaling with either collision frequency or magnetic curvature is weak, consistent with their weak qualitative effect. The result is that electron drift turbulence at L-H transition edge parameters is drift Alfven turbulence, with both ballooning and resistivity in a clear secondary role. The contents of the drift Alfven model will form a significant part of any useful first-principles computation of tokamak edge turbulence.},

abstract = {Drift waves occur universally in magnetized plasmas producing the dominant mechanism for the transport of particles, energy and momentum across magnetic field lines. A wealth of information obtained from quasistationary laboratory experiments for plasma confinement is reviewed for drift waves driven unstable by density gradients, temperature gradients and trapped particle effects. The modern understanding of Bohm transport and the role of sheared flows and magnetic shear in reducing the transport to the gyro-Bohm rate are explained and illustrated with large scale computer simulations. The types of mixed wave and vortex turbulence spontaneously generated in nonuniform plasmas are derived with reduced magnetized fluid descriptions. The types of theoretical descriptions reviewed include weak turbulence theory, Kolmogorov anisotropic spectral indices, and the mixing length. A number of standard turbulent diffusivity formulas are given for the various space-time scales of the drift-wave turbulent mixing.},

abstract = {Large-scale radial advection of isolated structures in nonuniformly magnetized plasmas is investigated. The underlying mechanism considered is due to the nonlinear evolution of interchange motions, without any presumption of plasma sheaths. Theoretical arguments supported by numerical simulations reveal an inertial scaling for the radial velocity of isolated structures in the ideal limit. This velocity increases as the square root of the structure size relative to the length scale of the magnetic field. The magnitude of the radial advection velocity, as well as the dynamical evolution of the structures, compares favorably with recent experimental measurements of radially propagating blob structures in the scrape-off layer of magnetically confined plasmas.},

abstract = {The spontaneous generation of large-scale flows by the rectification of small-scale turbulent fluctuations is of great importance both in geophysical flows and in magnetically confined plasmas. These flows regulate the turbulence and may set up effective transport barriers. In the present contribution the generation of zonal flows will be illustrated in a simple fluid experiment performed in a rotating container with radial symmetric bottom topography. An effective mixing that homogenizes the potential vorticity in the fluid layer will lead to the replacement of the high-potential vorticity near the centre with low potential vorticity from the outside, which will imply the formation of a large-scale flow. The experimental results are supported by direct numerical solutions of the quasi-geostrophic vorticity equation in the $\beta$-plane approximation modelling the experimental situation. The analogy to large-scale flow generation in drift-wave turbulence dynamics in magnetized plasma is briefly discussed.},

The decay rate of a conditional feature in time or space showed a small systematic variation with the amplitude of condition chosen. Either long-lived coherent structures are not present in statistically significant numbers, or the fluctuations are dominated by a large number of coherent structures with a nearly Gaussian distribution of fluctuation amplitudes, or conditional analysis using the amplitude of the floating potential as a condition is not a sensitive technique for identifying coherent structures.},

The linear machine is surrounded by a set of 68 magnet coils which can generate an axial magnetic field of up to 3000 G. The vacuum chamber has 128 radial ports to ensure excellent access for probes and antennas. An internal probe drive capable of moving a set of probes to any position within the plasma column is described in a companion paper. This machine is a scientific instrument in its own right and was designed to be versatile enough to study a large variety of phenomena. The techniques employed in the design and construction are sufficiently useful to be discussed here so that others can benefit from our experience.},

abstract = {The details of fluctuation free-energy conservation in gyrofluid models are examined. The polarization equation relates {\{}{\{}{\}}E×B{\{}{\}}{\}} flow and eddy energy to combinations of the potential and the density and perpendicular temperature. These determine the combinations which must appear under derivatives in the moment equations so that not only thermal free energy but also its combination with the {\{}{\{}{\}}E×B{\{}{\}}{\}} energy is properly conserved by the parallel and perpendicular compressional effects. The resulting system exhibits the same qualitative energy-transfer properties as corresponding Braginskii or Landau fluid models. One clear result is that the numerical model built on these equations is well behaved for arbitrarily large perpendicular wave number, allowing exploration of two scale phenomena linking dynamics at the ion and electron gyroradii. When the numerical formulation is done in the globally consistent flux tube model, the results with adiabatic electrons are consistent with the {\{}{\{}{\}}“Cyclone{\{}{\}}{\}} base case” results of gyrokinetic models.},

The simulations show a relation between self-generated poloidal shear flows and magnetic field perturbations. For large values of the plasma {\$}\beta{\$} we observe an increase of the transport if the viscous damping of the self-generated shear flows is absent. This behavior is in contrast to the standard argument that sheared flows suppress turbulence and transport via a decorrelation mechanism. An explanation of this behavior in terms of the transport related to magnetic flutter is proposed. The characteristics of the EB flux are investigated using probability density distribution functions (PDFs). Although they are not Gaussian, no signs of algebraic tails in the PDFs are observed. The PDFs of the pointwise transport are found to agree well with a folded Gaussian, while the PDFs of the spatially averaged transport are in good agreement with an extreme value distribution.},

A set of fast spectroscopic diagnostics has been designed to characterize both main plasma edge parameters and turbulence, including coherent structures (blobs) and radial profiles of the thermodynamic variables. Measurements of the edge radial profiles of electron density (n(e)), temperature (T(e)), and pressure (P(e)) are obtained by a thermal helium beam diagnostic, which locally measures the ratios of the spectral lines emitted by a neutral He cloud puffed into hydrogen plasma discharges. A gas puff imaging system allows the high frequency (1 MHz bandwidth) measurement of the fluctuations of He I emissivity in the same positions. The system measures both the intermittent behavior of the edge turbulence and n(e), T(e), and P(e) profiles of the corresponding coherent structures, with a resolution down to 6 {\$}\mu{\$}s. The optical diagnostics are complemented by a set of triaxial magnetic coils to simultaneously characterize the edge magnetic field.},

@article{Hariri2013,
abstract = {This work illustrates a new approach to field-aligned coordinates for plasma turbulence simulations which is not based on flux variables. The method employs standard Cartesian or polar coordinates to discretize the fields. Parallel derivatives are computed directly along a coordinate that follows the local field, and poloidal derivatives are computed in the original Cartesian frame. Several advantages of this approach are presented. The tests on a drift-wave model demonstrate that the method is well suited to exploit the flute property of small parallel gradients by minimizing the number of degrees of freedom needed to treat a given problem in an accurate and efficient manner. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A unified framework that explains popular operator splitting methods as special cases of a fully implicit approach is also presented and can be used for constructing new and improved solution strategies. The exposition is mostly neutral to the spatial discretization technique, but we cover the need for staggered grids or mixed finite elements and outline some alternative stabilization techniques that allow using standard grids. Emphasis is put on showing the close relationship between (seemingly) different and competing solution approaches for incompressible viscous flow.},

@article{DIppolito2011,
abstract = {A blob-filament (or simply “blob”) is a magnetic-field-aligned plasma structure which is considerably denser than the surrounding background plasma and highly localized in the directions perpendicular to the equilibrium magnetic field B. In experiments and simulations, these intermittent filaments are often formed near the boundary between open and closed field lines, and seem to arise in theory from the saturation process for the dominant edge instabilities and turbulence. Blobs become charge-polarized under the action of an external force which causes unequal drifts on ions and electrons; the resulting polarization-induced E × B drift moves the blobs radially outwards across the scrape-off-layer (SOL). Since confined plasmas generally are subject to radial or outwards expansion forces (e.g., curvature and ∇B forces in toroidal plasmas), blob transport is a general phenomenon occurring in nearly all plasmas. This paper reviews the relationship between the experimental and theoretical results on blob formation, dynamics and transport and assesses the degree to which blob theory and simulations can be compared and validated against experiments. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics},

@article{Sadighi2007,
abstract = {In this paper, He's variational iteration method is applied to obtain exact solutions of some nonlinear diffusion equations. The variational iteration method is used to construct correction functionals using general Lagrange multipliers identified optimally via the variational theory, and the initial approximations can be freely chosen with unknown constants. The solutions obtained are compared with those obtained by the Adomian decomposition method and homotopy perturbation method, showing excellent agreement, but the variational iteration method is more effective. He's variational iteration method can be introduced to overcome the difficulties arising in calculating Adomian polynomials.},
